##### 
Method: Built a real-time blink detection system using dlib and OpenCV by calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) from facial landmarks.

##### 
Results: Achieved accurate blink detection, applicable to driver fatigue monitoring and human-computer interaction.

#####
Required File for Execution:
To run the program, download the 68 facial landmarks model from:
http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2
